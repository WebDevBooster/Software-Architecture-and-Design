### Understand and Organize Requirements

One way to understand software requirements is to organize them based on the different aspects they represent in a software system.

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Business Requirement | High-level business objective e.g. increase user interaction |
| Business Rule | Policy, industry standards and regulations to adhere to e.g. ensure EU GDPR compliance |
| Technical Constraint | Development related choices, open for potential workarounds/alternatives e.g. use template XYZ |
| Functional Requirement | System behavior based on specific triggers e.g. upon logging in users get to see a popup |
| Non-functional Requirement | Generic system characteristic e.g. visible part of the site should load in under 1 second |
| External Interface Requirement | System integration e.g. get data from a vendor API |
