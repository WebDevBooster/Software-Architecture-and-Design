How to Write/Develop an Effective Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

1 Organization and Structure

### 1.1 Understand and Organize Requirements

One way to understand software requirements is to organize them based on the different aspects they represent in a software system.

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Business Requirement | High-level business objective e.g. increase user interaction |
| Business Rule | Policy, industry standards and regulations to adhere to e.g. ensure EU GDPR compliance |
| Technical Constraint | Development related choices, open for potential workarounds/alternatives e.g. use template XYZ |
| Functional Requirement | System behavior based on specific triggers e.g. upon logging in users get to see a popup |
| Non-functional Requirement | Generic system characteristic e.g. visible part of the site should load in under 1 second |
| External Interface Requirement | System integration e.g. get data from a vendor API |

### 1.2 Group Requirement Activities into Categories

* Requirement Development
  - Elicit
  - Specify
  - Analyze
  - Validate
  
* Requirement Management
  - Prioritize
  - Estimate
  - Schedule
  - Track

All of those activities need to be done regardless of the methodology or tools used for software development. 

Here's an example of how those activities could be integrated within the SCRUM framework: 

| Prioritize | Estimate | Schedule | Track |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create a product backlog i.e. a prioritized list of features to be developed | Pick a few features and estimate the required effort (Planning Poker) | Pick a few (1-3) top priority requirements and put them into the next sprint's backlog | Track the progress using something like a "burn-down chart" |
